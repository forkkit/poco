    		The first version of the Lost Ark Studio in San Diego, California was opened in early 2010. Back then it was a simple private project studio built to help a few friends in town record in a space a bit beyond the bedroom and garages being used at the time. The space has been expanded three times since then with trying to keep the spirit of the original studio, as Paul Cavanaugh, owner of Lost Ark tells us. „We‘re still helping indie artists and bands as the studio has become the home base for our label, Randm Records. Over the years we have been fortunate in that we have been able to host well over 100 artists/bands at the studio.

    		The studio‘s compilation series sessions have included artists from Southern California and across the States such as the Bastard Sons of Johnny Cash, Whiskey Shivers, Mother Falcon, Jesca Hoop, and My Goodness. More recently we‘ve been working on new albums for Jack Lawtey, Jeremiah Tall, The Peach Kings, and Old Man Canyon. From the beginning the Lost Ark Studio has been more of a home studio than a typical ‚for hire‘ studio. We designed it ourselves, we‘ve expanded it in response to what we‘ve learned through thousands of sessions and, regardless of who‘s recording with us, they are our guests, not clients. Add in that we have well over 200 vintage guitars, 100 vintage amps, and more than a few vintage keyboards, drum kits, snares, synths, etc. and it‘s not a bad place to call home!“
